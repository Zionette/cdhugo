The Global Ecovillage Network (GEN) catalyzes communities for a regenerative world. GEN 
is a growing network of regenerative communities and initiatives that bridge cultures, 
countries, and continents.

GEN builds bridges between policy-makers, governments, NGOs, academics, entrepreneurs, 
activists, community networks and ecologically-minded individuals across the globe in 
order to develop strategies for a global transition to resilient communities and cultures.

What is an Ecovillage?

An ecovillage is an intentional, traditional or urban community that is consciously 
designing its pathway through locally owned, participatory processes, and aiming to 
address the Ecovillage Principles in the 4 Areas of Regeneration (social, culture, 
ecology, economy into a whole systems design).
Ecovillages are living laboratories pioneering beautiful alternatives and innovative 
solutions. They are rural or urban settlements with vibrant social structures, vastly 
diverse, yet united in their actions towards low-impact, high-quality lifestyles.
