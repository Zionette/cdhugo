"In order to change an existing paradigm you do not struggle to try and change the problematic model.

You create a new model and make the old ones obsolete.  That, in essence, is the higher service to which we are all being called."

 ~ Buckminster Fuller ~

One Community is a 501(c)3 non-profit think tank. We are a 100%-volunteer organization 
and our mission is to help people create a better world by demonstrating a more 
sustainable and enriching way of living and open source everything needed for replication.
This includes free-shared and “Highest Good” approaches to food, energy, housing, education,
for-profit and non-profit economic design, social architecture, fulfilled living, global 
stewardship practices, and more. Combined, we will use these to build One Community as the 
first of many teacher/demonstration hubs. These hubs will form a global collaborative to 
provide even more research, blueprints, and necessary support for successively easier, more 
affordable, and creative duplication everywhere.
